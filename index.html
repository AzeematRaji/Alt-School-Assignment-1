    <p>My name is Azeemat Raji, I was born in Ilorin Kwara state on the 14th June 1998. I am the first daughter and I have two siblings named Kazeem and Akeemat. I love talking, hanging around friends, reading, travelling and meeting new people, I might just be an extrovert I am not even sure.</p>
    <p>I studied Biochemistry in the University of Ilorin, finished in the year 2018 then moved to Lagos afterwards. I am currently working on switching my carrer path to tech because I am passionate about learning and tech is a profession that requires you to learn continually.</p>
    <p>I am so excited to be on this journey with AltSchool, to guide me through and also really grateful for choosing me to among those that receive laptop to start their tech career, I promise to give back to the society in the future.</p>
